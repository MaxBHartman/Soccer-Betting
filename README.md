Using Statistics and Machine Learning to profit from soccer betting

1)
Collect all Premier League player/team/head-to-head data parsed into CSV files by season for forecasting.

2)
Predict the probability of Team A win (1), Team B win (2), or draw (3).

3)
Then calculate the expected winnings for different betting strategies (1 & 3, 2 & 3, 1, 2, or 3). If one of the potential strategies would have an expected winning above a set threshold, place the bet.
